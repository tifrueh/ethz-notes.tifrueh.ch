Greetings, dear traveller of the depths of the web, welcome to my note
collection. This is the place where I continually upload all the notes I make
during my studies at ETH Zurich. I'm not very sure that this will be of use to
anyone but me, but we'll see.

Please note, though, that while I have indeed written these notes, the actual
_content_ is intellectual property of the lecturers at ETH. Links and references
to all courses are provided on the course pages. Also note that, while the
original content _was_ produced by the lecturers at ETH, these notes are a
reformulation of mine, and are therefore prone to contain errors and
inaccuracies. If you find any of those, you're very welcome to send me an email
or open an issue or a merge request on the (ETH-internal) GitLab repositories on
which the cards are hosted. You'll find the links to those on the course pages
as well.

But, without further ado, I'll leave you to it. I hope you'll find what you're
looking for. Enjoy your stay!
